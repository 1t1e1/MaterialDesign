## How to Contribute

This project does not take pull requests as all icon designs go through community approval and design changes before being added.

There are two options for contributing listed below with steps to follow.

### I have an icon idea!

Awesome, please take a moment to search for the icon.

#### Icon Request Exists Already

So the icon request was created by someone else. You can do a few things to get our attention.

- Use the reaction button to upvote/downvote the first comment and any designs people have posted.
  - Don't feel bad about downvoting a design from a contributor, we're all use to it by now.
- Comment with example images (you can paste images in your comments).
  - Examples help our design contributors more accurately dipict the request.

#### Icon Request doesn't exist yet

So, it's a unique request and the issue doesn't exist.

- 1 Icon Request per issue
- Click the new issue button.
- The title of the issue should simply be the icon name `home`, `theater`, etc.
- The description should contain some context of where the icon will be used and the general look
  - You can paste reference images inline to give us a better idea.

### I'm an icon designer

Also awesome, please take a minute to search through the existing issues.
